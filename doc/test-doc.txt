1. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================


1.1 Background
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository provides small Minimal BASIC programs which are intended to
test the behavior of ECMA-55 conforming (see [ECMA55], appendix 3) interpreters
(e.g. the Retro ECMA-55-compliant Minimal BASIC Interpreter, see [RECMA55]).

While some programs are always expected to fail and other programs are always
expected to run in a precisely defined manner, some programs might depend on
"implementation-defined features" (see [ECMA55], appendix 4).

Development of this software is subject to Retro-BASIC and complies to the
[RETRO-FRAME COMMON DOCUMENTATION].


1.2 Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes for each test program its intention (what feature is
subject to test) and the expected behavior in terms of ECMA-55 conformance. In
addition, there are some demo programs which do not aim at specific features.

Information about conformance to other BASIC dialects is not provided.

Each chapter regarding test programs refers to one or more chapters of ECMA-55.
However, the number and even the order of the chapters of this document may
differ. All test programs covered by the same chapter use the same prefix in
the file names and are numbered according the sub-chapter number except that
the program file names use a leading zero for numbers below 10. The capters are
orderd by name of the prefix.

2. ARRAYS (ECMA-55 CHAPTERS 7 AND 18)
===============================================================================


2.1 ARRAY01.BAS - OPTION BASE 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program contains a valid OPTION BASE 0 and and END statement. It should
run but does not nothing.


2.2 ARRAY02.BAS - OPTION BASE 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program contains a valid OPTION BASE 1 and and END statement. It should
run but does not nothing.


2.3 ARRAY03.BAS - OPTION BASE N
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as OPTION BASE
N is an invalid statement (variables are not allowed). This is considered a
syntax error.


2.4 ARRAY04.BAS - OPTION 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the "BASE"
keyword is missing. This is considered a syntax error.


2.5 ARRAY05.BAS - multiple OPTION BASE statements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 20 (input line 2) as no more
than one OPTION BASE statement is allowed. This is considered an assertion
error.


2.6 ARRAY06.BAS - implicitly defined array and subscript out of range
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program implicitly defines A as an one-dimensional array. As implicitly
defined arrays in absence of an OPTION BASE statement should have valid
subscripts in the range 0..10, the following lines should be executed without
an error:

  10 LET A(0) = 0
  20 LET A(1) = 1
  30 LET A(10) = 1

However, the following line should raise an subscript out of range error:

  40 LET A(11) = 1

This is considered a run-time error.


2.7 ARRAY07.BAS - explicitly defined array and subscript out of range
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program defines A as an one-dimensional array with bound 2. In absence of
an OPTION BASE statement, valid subscripts should be in the range 0..2 and the
following lines should be executed without an error:

  20 LET A(0) = 0
  30 LET A(1) = 1
  40 LET A(2) = 2

However, the following line should raise an subscript out of range error:

  50 LET A(1E30) = 2

This is considered a run-time error.



3. CHARACTERS AND STRINGS, REMARK STATEMENT (ECMA-55 CHAPTERS 4 AND 19)
===============================================================================


3.1 CHAR01.BAS - REM and PRINT using conforming character set
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and just output

  HELLO, WORLD!

This fully ECMA-55 conformant string is used at line number 10 (input line 1)
as a remark-string of a remark-statement and at line number 20 (input line 2)
as a quoted-string of a print-statement.


3.2 CHAR02.BAS - REM and PRINT using lowercase letters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail at line number 10 (input line 1) if full ECMA-55
conformance is enforced because lower letters are used.

However, if lowercase characters are accepted and translated to uppercase
characters, the program should output

  HELLO, WORLD!

If lowercase characters are accepted but not translated, the program should
output

  Hello, world!

This ECMA-55 non-conformant string is used at line number 10 (input line 1) as
a remark-string of a remark-statement and at line number 20 (input line 2) as a
quoted-string of a print-statement.


3.3 CHAR03.BAS - REM and PRINT using non-ASCII letters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail if ECMA-55 conformance is enforced because non-ASCII
characters are used.

However, if Unicode characters are accepted, the program should output "Hello!"
in German, Spanish, Russian and Chinese.

The ECMA-55 non-conformant strings are used as remark-strings of remark-
statements respective quoted-strings of print-statements at

- line numbers 10 and 20 (input lines 1 and 2) using lowercase ASCII characters
- line numbers 30 and 40 (input lines 3 and 4) using character 0x41
- line numbers 50 and 60 (input lines 5 and 6) using cyrillic characters
- line numbers 70 and 80 (input lines 7 and 8) using chinese characters

Thus, if full ECMA-55 conformance is enforced, this program should fail at line
number 10 (input line 1) because lower letters are used. If Unicode, ANSI or
ASCII codepages 437 or 850 but no codepoints greater than 0xFF are accepted,
this program should fail at line number 30 (input line 3).



4. CONTROL STATEMENTS (ECMA-55 CHAPTER 12)
===============================================================================


4.1 CTRL01.BAS - GOTO 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as 0 is not a
valid line number. This is considered a syntax error.


4.2 CTRL02.BAS - GOTO non-existing backward line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the jump
target line does not exists. As the syntax is valid, it is considered an
assertion or run-time error.


4.3 CTRL03.BAS - GOTO current line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The this program results in an infinite loop. However, as it is a fully ECMA-55
conforming program, it should execute but must be haltet by a system-dependent
break command (e.g. Ctrl-C).


4.4 CTRL04.BAS - GOTO non-existing forward line number before end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the jump
target line does not exists. As the syntax is valid, it is considered an
assertion or run-time error.


4.5 CTRL05.BAS - GOTO end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully but without any output.


4.6 CTRL06.BAS - GOTO non-existing forward line number after end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the jump
target line number does not exists.


4.7 CTRL07.BAS - Simple IF loop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   10
   20
   30
   40
   50

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, each number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space. However, the purpose of this program is to test control
statements rather than print output.


4.8 CTRL08.BAS - Simple IF loop no space
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail if full ECMA-55 conformance is enforced because there
is no space between the keyword THEN and the jump target at line number 60
(input line 6) as required by the standard.

However, if spacing requirements are relaxed, the program might run and output
the following sequence:

   10
   20
   30
   40
   50

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, each number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space. However, the purpose of this program is to test control
statements rather than print output.


4.9 CTRL09.BAS - Simple loop with GOSUB after loop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   10
   20
   30
   40
   50

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, each number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space. However, the purpose of this program is to test control
statements rather than print output.


4.10 CTRL10.BAS - Simple loop with GO SUB before loop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   10
   20
   30
   40
   50

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, each number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space. However, the purpose of this program is to test control
statements rather than print output.


4.11 CTRL11.BAS - ON GOTO 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as 0 is not a
valid line number. This is considered a syntax error.


4.12 CTRL12.BAS - ON GOTO non-existing backward line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the jump
target line does not exists. As the syntax is valid, it is considered an
assertion or run-time error.


4.13 CTRL13.BAS - ON GOTO current line number
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The this program results in an infinite loop. However, as it is a fully ECMA-55
conforming program, it should execute but must be haltet by a system-dependent
break command (e.g. Ctrl-C).


4.14 CTRL14.BAS - ON GOTO non-existing forward line number before end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the jump
target line does not exists. As the syntax is valid, it is considered an
assertion or run-time error.


4.15 CTRL15.BAS - ON GOTO end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully but without any output.


4.16 CTRL16.BAS - ON GOTO non-existing forward line number after end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as the jump
target line number does not exists.


4.17 CTRL17.BAS - Simple ON GOTO statements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

  100
  200
  400
  300
  500

The list of line numbers of the ON GOTO statement have different but always
valid spacing between the line number and the comma.


4.18 CTRL18.BAS - Simple GOSUB statements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1
   102
   202
   303
   403

It uses nested GOSUB / RETURN statements.



5. DATA AND READ STATEMENTS (ECMA-55 CHAPTERS 16 AND 17)
===============================================================================


5.1 DATA01.BAS - Unquoted DATA and numeric READ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1              2              3

The numbers are represented as a DATA sequence and read by two READ statements.


5.2 DATA02.BAS - READ without DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) as there is a
READ statement without any DATA sequence. This is considered a run-time error.


5.3 DATA03.BAS - READ after end of DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 40 (input line 4) as there is a
READ statement to read three numeric variables but only two values are still
available in the DATA sequence. This is considered a run-time error.


5.4 DATA04.BAS - RESTORE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1              2              1              2              3

The numbers are represented as a DATA sequence of four values. However, after
two READ statements a RESTORE statement advises a subsequent READ statement
with three numeric variables to go back to the beginning of the DATA sequence.


5.5 DATA05.BAS - Quoted and unquoted DATA on string READ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

  1
  2
  HELLO

Note that there is no leading or trailing space in the output as the READ
statement has three string variables while the frist value 1 is represented as
an unquoted string and the others as quoted strings in the DATA sequence.


5.6 DATA06.BAS - Quoted and unquoted DATA on numeric READ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should start and output the following value:

   1

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, the number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space as the READ statement uses a numeric variable for the value
1 which is represented as an unquoted string in the DATA sequence.

After that output, a subsequent READ statement using a numeric variable on the
value 2 which is represented as a quoted string in the DATA sequence should
fail at line number 40 (input line 4). This is considered a run-time error.

However, if quoting requirements are relaxed, the program might accept the
quoted numeric value and output it as well:

   2

In any case, a subsequent READ statement using a numeric variable on the value
text "HELLO" which is represented as a quoted string in the DATA sequence
should fail at line number 60 (input line 6). This is considered a run-time
error.



6. USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS (ECMA-55 CHAPTER 10)
===============================================================================


6.1 DEF01.BAS - Constant functions with different spaces
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following value:

   103

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, each number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space. The value is calculated by summing up three user defined
functions which return a fixed value of 1, 2.0 and 1E2 (i.e. 1, 2 and 100).


6.2 DEF02.BAS - Function without parameter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output 11 pseudo-random values,
each greater or equal than 0 and less than 1 as a user defined function without
argument calls the RND function.

The RANDOMIZE statement may cause a user input before the output. Unless the
same seed is supplied, each run of the program should output different values.


6.3 DEF03.BAS - Function with parameter using same name as a variable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1
   2
   5
   10
   17
   26
   37
   50
   65
   82
   101

According to ECMA-55, chapter 14.4, each number should be preceded as well as
trailed by a space. The values are calculated including a user defined function
with an argument. The function uses two variables where one is the argument
(although a global variable of the same name exists) and one is a global
variable.


6.4 DEF04.BAS - Functions which use other user defined functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   0              1

The first value is calculated using three user defined functions where one is
called by the PRINT statement directly and the other ones be another user
defined function. Each function has an argument with the same name as global
variables. Thus, arguments and global variables must be referenced properly
even on nested function calls.



7. EXPRESSIONS (ECMA-55 CHAPTER 8)
===============================================================================


7.1 EXPR01.BAS - Simple operator expressions with two operands
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

  2 + 3 =  5
  2 - 3 = -1
  2 * 3 =  6
  2 / 3 =  .666667
  2 ^ 3 =  8

While the operation is printed as a string, the last value in each line is
calculated by the corresponding expression.


7.2 EXPR02.BAS - Simple use of built-in functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

  ABS(-2.4) =  2.4
  ATN( 0.5) =  .463648
  COS(-1.0) =  .540302
  EXP( 3.1) =  22.1979
  INT(-2.4) = -3
  LOG(1000) =  6.90776
  RND       =  <value1>
  RND       =  <value2>
  RND       =  <value3>
  RND       =  <value4>
  SGN(+1.1) =  1
  SGN(-1.1) = -1
  SGN( 0.0) =  0
  SIN( 0.0) =  0
  SIN( 3.1) =  4.15808E-02
  SIN( 3.2) = -5.83742E-02
  SQR(16.0) =  4
  TAN( 0.5) =  .546302

While the operation is printed as a string, the last value in each line is
calculated by the corresponding expression. Note that <value1>, <value2>,
<value3> and <value4> may differ on each system. However, as not RANDOMIZE
statement is used, the values should be the same on each run.


7.3 EXPR03.BAS - More complex operator expressions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

  A = 1 * 2 + 3 / 4 =  2.75 (2.75)
  -3 ^ 2 / 2 - 1.5 = -6 (-6)
  -1.5 + 1 / 2 ^ 2 = -1.25 (-1.25)
  (-1.5+1)/((-5+4)*2)^2 = -.125 (-.125)
  -1.5 - A + (-2) ^ 3 / 2 = -8.25 (-8.25)
  B =  1.5 (1.5)
  A * (3 + A ^ (B - (A / A)) + 1) + B / 2 - 3 13.3104 (13.3104)

While the expression and the last value in parenthesis are printed as a
string, the second last value in each line is calculated by the corresponding
expression and should equal the value in parenthesis.


8. FOR AND NEXT STATEMENTS (ECMA-55 CHAPTER 13)

8.1 FOR01.BAS - Simple loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1
   2
   3
   4
   5

The numbers are the control-variable of a FOR-NEXT statement from 1 to 5 with
an implicit step of 1.


8.2 FOR02.BAS - Simple loop to print numbers from 5 to 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   5
   4
   3
   2
   1

The numbers are the control-variable of a FOR-NEXT statement from 5 to 1 with a
step of -1.


8.3 FOR03.BAS - Loop to print numbers from 1 to 5 using GOSUB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1
   2
   3
   4
   5

The numbers are the control-variable of a FOR-NEXT statement from 1 to 5 with
an implicit step of 1. However, the PRINT statement is outside the for-body and
called by a GOSUB statement within.


8.4 FOR04.BAS - GOTO from for-body to for-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5

The numbers are the control-variable of a FOR-NEXT statement from 1 to 5 with
an implicit step of 1. However, a global variable controls a single GOTO to the
FOR statement once before the NEXT statement is reached.

This should be allowed according to ECMA-55, chapter 13.4 although the for-line
is not part of the for-body as transfer of control out of a for-body seems to
be allowed (unlike transfer of control into a for-body).


8.5 FOR05.BAS - GOTO into for-body
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 60 (input line 6) as there is a
GOTO statement which transfers control into a for-body which is not allowed
according to ECMA-55, chapter 13.4.

However, if this condition is relaxed, the program may run and output the
following sequence:

   1
   2
   3
   4
   5

The actual flow of control results in a program which behaves as the PRINT
statement was called by a GOSUB statement and returns into the for-body by a
RETURN statement.


8.6 FOR06.BAS - Nested loops
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1              10             90
   1              10             91
   1              10             92
   1              20             90
   1              20             91
   1              20             92
   1              30             90
   1              30             91
   1              30             92
   2              10             90
   2              10             91
   2              10             92
   2              20             90
   2              20             91
   2              20             92
   2              30             90
   2              30             91
   2              30             92
   3              10             90
   3              10             91
   3              10             92
   3              20             90
   3              20             91
   3              20             92
   3              30             90
   3              30             91
   3              30             92
   4              10             90
   4              10             91
   4              10             92
   4              20             90
   4              20             91
   4              20             92
   4              30             90
   4              30             91
   4              30             92
   5              10             90
   5              10             91
   5              10             92
   5              20             90
   5              20             91
   5              20             92
   5              30             90
   5              30             91
   5              30             92

The numbers are the control-variables of three nested FOR-NEXT statements using
different start, end and step values.


8.7 FOR07.BAS - Interleaved nested loops
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 60 (input line 6) as there is a
NEXT statement with the control-variable of on outer for-block while a middle
for-block has not been terminated (unlike an inner for-block). Thus, the both
outer for-blocks are interleaved which is not allowed according to ECMA-55,
chapter 13.4.


8.8 FOR07.BAS - Conditionally skipping loop
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output the following sequence:

   1              10             90
   1              10             91
   1              10             92
   1              20             90
   1              20             91
   1              20             92
   1              30             90
   1              30             91
   1              30             92
   2              10             90
   2              10             91
   2              10             92
   2              20             90
   2              20             91
   2              20             92
   2              30             90
   2              30             91
   2              30             92
   3              10             90
   3              10             91
   3              10             92
   4              10             90
   4              10             91
   4              10             92
   5              10             90
   5              10             91
   5              10             92

The numbers are the control-variables of three nested FOR-NEXT statements using
different start, end and step values. However, a conditional jump depending on
the value of the outer control-variable is made which skips the NEXT statement
of the inner for-body.

This should be allowed according to ECMA-55, chapter 13.4 as transfer of
control out of a for-body seems to be allowed (unlike transfer of control into
a for-body).


9. INPUT STATEMENT (ECMA-55 CHAPTER 15)
===============================================================================


9.1 INPUT01.BAS - Simple string input and echo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and prompt for text user input
which is echoed. Note that if characters which must not be part of an unquoted
string are used on input, the entire input must be enclosed in double-quotes.


9.2 INPUT02.BAS - Simple numeric input and echo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and prompt for numeric user input
which is echoed.


9.3 INPUT03.BAS - Input of numeric array element and echo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and prompt for numeric user input
which is stored in an implicitly defined array and echoed.


9.4 INPUT04.BAS - Input of multiple string and numeric variables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and prompt for multiple user
input consisting of a numeric, text, numeric and text value. While all values
are read by a single INPUT statement, they are echoed by individual PRINT
statements. Note that all values must be separated by commas and that text
values may or may not be quoted strings.



10. PRINT STATEMENT AND CONSTANTS (ECMA-55 CHAPTERS 6 AND 14)
===============================================================================


10.1 PRINT01.BAS - Simple string output
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and just output

  HELLO, WORLD!

The print-statement at line number 10 (input line 1) contains only one quoted-
strings as a parameter. There should be a line break after the output. Note
that there may be line breaks added by the interpreter or the operating system
when the program terminates. Therefore, the output should be compared with the
output of the program PRINT02.BAS.


10.2 PRINT02.BAS - Simple string output trailed by semicolon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and just output

  HELLO, WORLD!

The print-statement at line number 10 (input line 1) contains only one quoted-
strings as a parameter, trailed by a semicolon. Thus, there should be no line
break after the output. Note that there may be line breaks added by the
interpreter or the operating system when the program terminates. Therefore, the
output should be compared with the output of the program PRINT01.BAS.


10.3 PRINT03.BAS - String output concatenated by semicolons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and just output

  HELLO, WORLD!

The print-statement at line number 10 (input line 1) consists of three quoted-
strings which are separated by a semicolon. There should be a line break after
the output. Note that there may be line breaks added by the interpreter or the
operating system when the program terminates. Therefore, the output should be
compared with the output of the program PRINT04.BAS.


10.4 PRINT04.BAS - String output concatenated and trailed by semicolons
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and just output

  HELLO, WORLD!

The print-statement at line number 10 (input line 1) consists of three quoted-
strings which are separated by a semicolon and is trailed by three semicolons.
Thus, there should be no line break after the output. Note that there may be
line breaks added by the interpreter or the operating system when the program
terminates. Therefore, the output should be compared with the output of the
program PRINT03.BAS.


10.5 PRINT05.BAS - Integer number output
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run successfully and output

11. PROGRAM STRUCTURE (ECMA-55 CHAPTER 5)
===============================================================================


11.1 PROG01.BAS - Empty file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail at input line 1 if full ECMA-55 conformance is
enforced because an end-line is missing. This might be a general, load or
syntax error.

However, if an end-line is not required, the program should run and terminate
without any output.


11.2 PROG02.BAS - File containing "TEST" only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at input line 1 because a line number is
expected and "TEST" is not a valid statement. This should be a load or syntax
error.


11.3 PROG03.BAS - File containing "0" only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at input line 1 because 0 is not a valid line
number and a statement is missing. This should be a load or syntax error.


11.4 PROG04.BAS - File containing "0 TEST" only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at input line 1 because 0 is not a valid line
number and "TEST" is not a valid statement. This should be a load or syntax
error.


11.5 PROG05.BAS - File containing "10000 TEST" only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at input line 1 because 10000 is not a valid
line number and "TEST" is not a valid statement. This should be a load or
syntax error.


11.6 PROG06.BAS - File containing "10X" only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at input line 1 because there is no space
after the line number and "TEST" is not a valid statement. This should be a
load or syntax error.


11.7 PROG07.BAS - File containing "10 TEST" only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 10 (input line 1) because "TEST"
is not a valid statement. This should be a syntax error.


11.8 PROG08.BAS - REM with edging program line length
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail at line number 10 (input line 2) if ECMA-55
conformance is enforced because the second input line consists of a program
line length of 73 characters while the line number 1 (input line 1) consists of
a program line length of 72 characters and should be accepted.

However, if longer program lines are accepted, the program should run and
terminate without any output.


11.9 PROG09.BAS - Duplicate end-lines
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 11 (input line 2) because there
should be no more statements after an end-line. This should be a load or
assertion error.


11.10 PROG10.BAS - Statement after end-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always fail at line number 11 (input line 2) because there
should be no more statements after an end-line. This should be a load or
assertion error.


11.11 PROG11.BAS - Simple valid program but line numbers not in order
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail at line number 10 (input line 2) if full ECMA-55
conformance is enforced because the lines are not in order.

However, if unordered line are accepted, the program should run and terminate
without any output.


11.12 PROG12.BAS - File containing end-line only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should always run and terminate without any output.


11.13 PROG13.BAS - Simple valid program with empty lines
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program should fail at input line 1 if full ECMA-55 conformance is
enforced because each line shall begin with a line number.

However, if empty lines are ignored, the program should run and terminate
without any output.
